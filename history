# This code will take the pulse of a user in conjuntion with heartrate.py and store previous readings into an array

# Import necessary libraries
from machine import pin, signal, ADC
import time

# Store previous readings in an array
maximumHistory = 500
history = []

while True:
    previousReadings = adc.read()

history.append(previousReadings)

#Define constraints of the array
history = history[ -maximumHistory: ]
minimum, maximum = min(history), max(history)

#Turn on sensor if array is not overloaded
on = (((minimum + maximum) * 3) // 4)
off = ((minimum + maximum) // 2)

if previousReadings > on:
    led.on()

if previousReadings < off:
    led.off()
