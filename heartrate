# This code will take the pulse of a user from an inputted sensor and output BPM and heart rate in a graph

# Define libraries
from machine import Pin, Signal, ADC, Timer


# Define variables
adc = machine.ADC(0)
heartBeat = False
beats = 0

# Calculate BPM from inputted sensor
def calculateBPM(beats):
# Starting with no beats, take readings every 15 seconds and multiply by 4 for 60 seconds
    print('BPM:', beats * 4) 
    beats = 0

# Set sensor to take reading every 15 seconds
timer = Timer(1)
timer.init(period=10000, mode=Timer.PERIODIC, callback=calculate_bpm)

while True:
    previousReadings = adc.read()
    history.append(previousReadings)

    #Define constraints of the array
    history = history[ -maximumHistory: ]
    minimum, maximum = min(history), max(history)


    on = (((minimum + maximum * 3)) // 4)   
    off = ((minimum + maximum) // 2)     

    if not beat and v > on:
        beat = True
        beats += 1
        led.on()

    if beat and v < off:
        beat = False
        led.off()
